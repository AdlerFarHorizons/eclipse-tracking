In order for the process.py script to startup on Raspberry Pi startup, we modified the .bashrc file in the home directory
of the Pi user. We then used "sudo raspi-config" to change the boot options to boot to the console with autologin for the Pi user.
In the .bashrc, we added the following lines to the very end of the file:
"cd eclipse-tracking/software/Pi"
"./init.sh"

Be sure Pi has permission to run init.sh. If not, you can change it using the chmod command.
